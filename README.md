# Memory Game

In this game application, you can play a simple game to pass your time and relax your mind. The objective of the game is to choose two identical pairs of images. When you correctly match all 8 pairs, you win the game. Otherwise, you can try again. I've learned and implemented this game from CodingNepal (YouTube channel).
